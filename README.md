# KaggleTraining
Space for training on Kaggle data

We will use the knowledge held within the team as well as takig inspiration from other Kaggle users to try to get our best solve for these problems.

## Challenge 1: Titanic
We will start here as a good entry level challenge. There is space for EDA and modelling as well as some feature engineering.
